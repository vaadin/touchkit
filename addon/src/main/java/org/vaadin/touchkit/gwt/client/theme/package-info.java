/**
 * Contains the TouchKit theme, which is bundled in the
 * widget set by the GWT compiler.
 *
 * Create a custom theme by adding a theme as described in
 * <a href="https://vaadin.com/book/vaadin7/-/page/themes.html">Book of Vaadin</a>.
 * You don't need to {@code @import} any css as the base
 * TouchKit theme is baked into the widget set.
 *
 * A custom theme can also be created by specifying a new widget set that inherits
 * from TouchKitWidgetSet and includes your CSS and image resources.
